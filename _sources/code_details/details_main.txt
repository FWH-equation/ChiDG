.. rubric:: Overview

From a high-level perspective, ChiDG is a library. A ChiDG environment can 
be imported from the library and used by some driver. For example, the ChiDG
executable is just a driver file that links with the ChiDG library and
creates a ChiDG-object, which is then used to initialize the framework,
read data, and run a simulation.

.. rubric:: ChiDG Library: libchidg.a

The ChiDG library contains the infrastructure(classes, datatypes, etc.)
for representing concepts related to solving partial differential 
equations on discretizations of space and time. These are things like
a computational grid, equation sets, time integrators, etc. 
The ChiDG library also contains a ChiDG API. This is provided through 
an object ``chidg_t``. In this way, all of the capability of the ChiDG 
library can be accessed and driven by creating a ``chidg`` object, and 
using high-level routines that it provides. Things like 
``chidg%read_grid('mygrid.h5')`` and ``chidg%set('Time Integrator', 'Quasi-Newton')``.
