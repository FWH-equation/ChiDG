Build ChiDG from source
=======================

Obtaining ChiDG
---------------
ChiDG is hosted on GitHub and may be cloned using the https protocol as

::

    git clone https://github.com/nwukie/ChiDG.git ChiDG



Dependencies
------------
ChiDG depends on several external libraries and applications.

| CMake
| HDF5
| TecIO (distributed with ChiDG)
|


CMake
-----
ChiDG uses the CMake build-sytem to generate the ``make`` configuration
files for the project. If you do not already have CMake installed on your
system, you should be able to download a package/binary from the CMake Website.


HDF5
----
HDF5 is used as a container for the ChiDG-formatted grid/solution files and
is a required dependency of ChiDG

HDF5 Website

The HDF5 library gives the option to build various portions of the library
itself, depending on what the user needs available. ChiDG uses the HDF5
Fortran module interfaces and the high-level API. Be sure to configure with the 
appropriate flags when building HDF5. Refer to the HDF5 documentation and 
installation guide for complete directions. Likely configuration parameters 
that are needed are:

::

    --enable-fortran
    --enable-fortran2003

The ChIDG CMake build will try to automatically locate the HDF5 libraries and
modules. To ensure they are found, **be sure to set the HDF5_ROOT environment 
variable** such that the directory includes the ``bin``, ``lib``, and ``include``
directories where the libraries and modules can be located





TecIO
-----
Tecplot 360 is currently the primary visualization tool used for ChiDG.
The TecIO libraries are distributed with the ChiDG project for multiple
systems and should be linked automatically without user intervention.
If, for some reason, the packaged TecIO library is incompatible with
your system, new libraries can be downloaded from the Tecplot website.

Compiling ChiDG
---------------

**Up-to-date Fortran(F2008) compiler required. Tested with gfortran 5.3**

ChiDG uses the CMake build system. Out-of-source build, as described here, 
are the only supported build method.


    - Change to the ChiDG root directory:

    ::

        cd ChiDG/


    - Create a new build directory:
 
    ::
 
        mkdir build

    - Change to the build directory:
 
    ::
 
        cd build

    - Configure with CMake including user options:
 
    ::
 
        cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

    - Run ``make`` to build the ChiDG library and interfaces:
 
    ::
 
        make
