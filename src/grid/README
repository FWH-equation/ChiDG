The ChiDG grid is organized hierarchically:

    : mesh_t
        :: domain_t
            ::: element_t
            ::: face_t
        :: domain_t
            ::: element_t
            ::: face_t



There are also some data types that represent connectivity information
for these objects:
    
    type_domain_connectivity
    type_element_connectivity
    type_face_connectivity
    type_boundary_connectivity



In a ChiDG environment, there is one instance of mesh_t. The mesh
contains domain_t's and domain_t's contain element_t's and face_t's.




There are some other utility type modules organized here.

    mod_interpolate
    ---------------
    provides the interpolation infrastructure for ChiDG. This interpolates modal quantities
    to discrete nodal locations. It also contains a lot of the automatic differentiation infrastructure.


    mod_DNAD_tools
    --------------
    this contains some helper routines that return information about the element that is
    being differentiated with respect to.


    mod_grid
    --------
    this generates the mapping data used for reference elements. It also provides information
    about element structures, such as which nodes are corners.
