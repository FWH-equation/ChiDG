There are a number of different files and constructs related to IO that exist here.
Their primary purposes are:

    - Convert grids generated by other tools into ChiDG-readable format
    - ChiDG-format API
    - Enable visualization by tools such as Tecplot and Paraview.




Plot3D Utilities
----------------

mod_plot3d_utilities.f90 
contains routines to get information from plot3d-like 
grids that can be used for ChiDG-readable files. These routines get used 
in the 'chidg convert' action to convert Plot3D grid files to ChiDG grid files.





HDF Utilities
-------------

mod_hdf_utilities.f90 
contains lower-level routines that handle the ChiDG file format, which uses HDF
as the container. These routines might handle activities like setting/checking 
file versions, setting the number of domains that exists in the file etc.

mod_hdfio.f90 
is a higher-level module that handles broader concepts of interacting with the 
ChiDG-file, such as reading grids, writing solutions, etc.




Visualization
-------------

mod_tecio.f90
contains routines for initializing/writing ChiDG-data to Tecplot files that can be read in
Tecplot.

mod_vtk_calc_func.f90
contains routines for getting coordinate and solution values at all points in 
the domain using their respective modal solutions. Also computes connectivity
information for the unstructured grid format

mod_vtk_file_unstr.f90
contains routines for writing ChiDG-data (from mod_vtk_calc_func.f90) to .pvd
file which can be read in Paraview. The .pvd file is a collection of blockwise
.vtu files

mod_vtkio.f90
uses routines from mod_vtk_calc_func and mod_vtk_file_unstr to write the final
chidg_results.pvd file
